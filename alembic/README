Alembic migration environment for FinInsight.

- Uses DATABASE_URL from .env via app.config.Settings (pydantic-settings)
- Imports all models in app/models/ for autogenerate
- Compatible with SQLAlchemy 2.0 and PostgreSQL

# Usage

1. Create a new migration (autogenerate):
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "init"

2. Apply migrations:
   alembic upgrade head

# Notes
- Ensure your .env is present and DATABASE_URL is set.
- All models in app/models/ are imported automatically for schema detection.
- See alembic/env.py for details.
